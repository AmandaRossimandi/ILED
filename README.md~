# ILED
Incremental Learning Event Definitions


ILED is an incremental Inductive Logic Programming system, for learning event-based knowledge, in the form of Event Calculus theories.
It is based on Abductive-Inductive Logic Programming and it is implemented in Python 2.7, using an ASL solver (Clingo) as the main 
reasoning Component. Please consult the following papers to get a grasp on the theory behind ILED:
